# demo-code
This repo contains a small selection of python and bash code to provide examples of some of my bionformatics/computational biology skills.

To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need to be in an environment with all the dependencies listed in `demo_env.yml`.

If you have conda installed on your machine, you can quickly set up a new conda environemnt with these dependencies by running the following from the terminal:
```
conda env create -f demo_env.yml
```
Then, activate this environment by running:
```
conda activate code-demo-2025
```
Once you have the environment set up, select it as your kernel from VS Code or JupyterLab.
